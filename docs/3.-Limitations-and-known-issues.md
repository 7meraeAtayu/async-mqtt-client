# Limitations and known issues

* Clean session flag is set to 1. This means retransmission of messages that failed to be sent is disabled.
* The client will allocate a char array of the size of the payload. This means if you send a too big payload to the ESP8266, it will crash.
* SSL is not doable at the moment.
